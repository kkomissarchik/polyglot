# Project Polyglot

Project Polyglot is a learning resource for comparing and contrasting implementations of the same requirements
using different programming languages and technical stacks.

This project is similar to other programming chrestomathy efforts, such [Rosetta Code](http://www.rosettacode.org),
but with emphasis on runnable projects rather than code snippets.

Why polyglot? A polyglot is someone who can speak or use several different languages.

## Hello Example

A simple function with a command line interface and unit tests.

* Provide a function that takes an optional name parameter and returns either "Hello!" or "Hello, [name]!",
  dependent on whether a name is provided
* Provide a way to invoke this function from the command line
* Provide unit tests

[Solutions](hello/README.md)

## Build Example

A build system that compiles the source code and runs the unit tests.

* Provide a facility to compile the source code
* Provide a facility to run the unit tests
